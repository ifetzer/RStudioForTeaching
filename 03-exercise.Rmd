Lets practice what we learnt. There are two datasets on the `data` folder:

- `Artificial_community_data_long.txt`
- `Artificial_community_data.txt`

1. Fit a principal component analysis
2. Fit a clustering routinge (e.g. `kmeans`, `hclust`)
3. Combine the two results on one plot
4. Discuss in couples how to interpret the results, share key lessons with the class

BONUS: Use `NbClust` and `clValid` to perform a sensitivity analysis on the number of clusters and best algorithms for the data.

```{r}
library(vegan)
library(clValid)
library(NbClust)
```
